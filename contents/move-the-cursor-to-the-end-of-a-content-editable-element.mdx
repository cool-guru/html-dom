title: Move the cursor to the end of a contentEditable element
---

At times, you may need to move the cursor to the end of a contenteditable element. This can come in handy when you want to focus on an empty element or add new content at the end.

For instance, imagine a chat application where users can reply to a message. It would be great if the cursor automatically moved to the end of the input field, which would already contain the original message, every time they start replying. This way, users don't have to manually move the cursor each time they want to type something new.

Another example is when you're building an editor. In this case, it's crucial that the cursor always stays at the end of the text so that users can continue typing without worrying about moving the cursor around. This can save them a lot of time and effort, and make their overall experience much smoother.

There are also situations where you might want to move the cursor to the end of an element programmatically. For example, if you have an input field with some text, but you want to add more text dynamically using JavaScript, you will need to move the cursor to the end of the input field before adding new text.

To move the cursor to the end of a contenteditable element, we can use a `Range` object. We simply set the start and end points of the range to be at the very end of our element, and then add this range to our selection using `window.getSelection().addRange()`.

Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

```js
const moveCursorToEnd = () => {
    const range = document.createRange();
    const selection = window.getSelection();
    range.setStart(contentEle, contentEle.childNodes.length);
    range.collapse(true);
    selection.removeAllRanges();
    selection.addRange(range);
};
```

To start, we create a new `Range` object by calling `document.createRange()`. Then, we position the start of the range at the very end of our `contentEle` node by setting its starting node as `contentEle` and its offset as `contentEle.childNodes.length`.

Next, we collapse the range to ensure that only one point in our contenteditable element is selected. We do this by calling `range.collapse(true)`, which sets the endpoint equal to the start point.

Finally, we remove any existing ranges from our selection by calling `sel.removeAllRanges()`. Then, we add our newly created range to the selection using `sel.addRange(range)`.

        range.collapse(true);
        selection.removeAllRanges();
        selection.addRange(range);
    };

    jumpButton.addEventListener('click', handleJump);
});
