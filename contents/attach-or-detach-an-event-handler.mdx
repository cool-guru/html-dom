## Use the on attribute (not recommended)

You can set the event handler via the `on{eventName}` attribute, where `eventName` represents the name of event.
For example:

```js
ele.onclick = function() {
    ...
};

// Remove the event handler
delete ele.onclick;
```

This approach isn't recommended because we can only attach one handler for each event. Setting the `onclick` attribute, for example, will override any existing handler for the `click` event.

## Use the addEventListener method

```js
const handler = function() {
    ...
};

// Attach handler to the `click` event
ele.addEventListener('click', handler);

// Detach the handler from the `click` event
ele.removeEventListener('click', handler);
```

Note that the event name is passed as the first parameter in both the `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
It differs from the first approach which requires to prefix the event name with `on`.

If you want the handler to be invoke once, then look at the [Create one time event handler](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/create-one-time-event-handler) post.
