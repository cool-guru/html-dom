If you need to know when a user clicks outside of a specific element or text selection on a web page, you can use JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM) to get the job done.

First, add an event listener to the `document` object to detect clicks anywhere on the page. This way, you can capture clicks that happen outside of the selected text.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    // Code to execute when the user clicks outside of the selected text
    // ...
});
```

Next, to figure out if the click happened inside or outside of the selected text, you'll need to retrieve the current selection. This can be done easily with the `getSelection()` method.

```js
const selection = window.getSelection();
```

You can use the `containsNode()` method to check if a click occurred outside of the selected text. This method requires two arguments: the node to check and a `boolean` value that indicates whether the node should be checked for partial inclusion in the selection.

```js
const clickedElement = e.target;
if (!selection.containsNode(clickedElement, true)) {
    // ...
}
```

Here's the complete JavaScript DOM code to check if users click outside of selected text.

```js
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const selection = window.getSelection();
    const clickedElement = e.target;
    if (!selection.containsNode(clickedElement, true)) {
        // Code to execute when the user clicks outside of the selected text
        // ...
    }
});
```

With this code, you can detect when a user clicks outside of a selected text on your web page. This allows you to execute the appropriate code to handle this event and take necessary actions.
