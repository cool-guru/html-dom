import { PostLayout } from '../layouts/PostLayout';

Assume that `ele` represents the element that you want to check if it has the focus currently:

```js
const hasFocus = ele === document.activeElement;
```

export default ({ children }) => (
    <PostLayout keywords="" title="Detect if an element is focused">
        {children}
    </PostLayout>
);
